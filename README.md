# 本地化 Localisation

This repos hosts all the localisation (i18n) files for the site. Any suggested changes should be made as merge requests. Merged requests will become visible on-site.

## Languages

Currently we have localisation done for English, Mandarin (Taiwan and Mainland PRC) and mostly done for Korean. We will accept other localisation submissions beyond these languages. We are actively looking for help with finishing Korean, as well as setting up a Burmese/Myanma localisation.
