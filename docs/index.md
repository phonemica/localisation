# 本地化

Localisation is important to us. We want to make sure that people can browse the project in their preferred language. Right now, we've got English and Mandarin (simplified and traditional characters) covered, as well as most of the interface translated into Korean. But it's not enough.

This repository is home to our localisation files. The data files stored here are where the site gets all the text — aside from things like story transcripts — that you see on-site. We're always looking to expand, as well as to improve the translations we have.

# Priorities

The following are what we'd like to get done, in order of importance:

## High priority

- Separation of Hong Kong `zh_HK` and Taiwanese Mandarin `zh_TW` in cases where they differ.
- Inclusion of Singapore Mandarin `zh_SG`
- Completion of the Korean `ko` localisation

## Medium priority

- Addition of Burmese/Myanmar `my` localisation

## Lower priority

- Tai Shan
- Assamese
- Thai
- any additional language

Any contributions toward any of these languages — or any other languages not listed — will be greatly appreciated, and any contributors will be listed here.

# How to contribute

The easiest way to contribute is through this repository. To make changes or add localisations, just clone the repository, make whatever additions you would like to make, and then send those in as a merge requests. Accepted contributions will then be merged and visible to users of the website.
